\section{Enterprise Model}
A clerk in head office (or operational manager) sets the routes and times they want for the bus lines.

Drivers are assigned to the routes, reducing the total time of the route to their contracted hours: the closest it gets to 0 the better(hours left to allocate).

Customers look at the timetable for the line, without knowing who the driver is, and choose the bus they want to take,

They board the bus, pay the driver, or show them a previously bought and still valid ticket, and take a seat.
