\chapter{Background \& Rationale}

\section{Enterprise Model}

A clerk in the head office (or operational manager) sets the routes and times they want for the bus lines.

Drivers are assigned to the routes, reducing the total time of the route to their contracted hours. The closer it is to zero (hours left to allocate) the better.

Customers can look at the timetable for the line, without knowing who the driver is, and choose the bus they want to take.

The customers board the bus, pay the driver, or show them a previously bought and still valid ticket, and take a seat.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Enable users to login and register
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Normal (unprivileged users) can register anytime
      \item Privileged users must be added by an admin
    \end{itemize}
  \item Enable users and visitors to see bus timetables
  \item Enable registered users to save their favourite routes
  \item Allow admins and authorised staff to change timetables and rotas
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Create bus lines and routes
      \item Allocate staff to lines
    \end{itemize}
  \item Allow staff to see their rota
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Staff assigned to particular routes
      \item Staff dashboard allows to print weekly rota as a pdf
    \end{itemize}
  \item The users should be able to search routes by terms, e.g route code, town names or bus stop names
\end{itemize}

Out of these requirements, we were able to implement all but one, that being the one that would allow the staff to see their rota, since we were left with less time to implement the project due to our approach and technologies chosen, that we had to learn in order to implement the project.

  \end{enumerate}
  \item Develop a timetabling service for buses
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement bus lines
    \item Implement bus routes for each line
    \item Implement bus stops and allow associating routes with these stops
    \item Build a front-end for route information
    \item Allow customers to favourite the routes and lines
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Check the implemented system satisfies the functional
  requirements outlined by the business goals
